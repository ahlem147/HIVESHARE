 I'm delighted to have the opportunity to speak with you today.

Hello, my name is Ahlem Riahi. I am 24 years old and , I am currently pursuing my engineering degree in evening classes at Sesame University to further refine my skills
 Of course, I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I studied at the Higher Institute of Multimedia Arts in Manouba.
I am a web developer specialized in bug fixing and developing new features, with two and a half years of experience. Currently, I am employed at VERMEG, a company that specializes in software solutions for banking, capital markets, and insurance sectors.
During my time at VERMEG, I have worked on critical projects where fast and efficient problem-solving was essential. This has strengthened my ability to analyze challenges, propose  solutions, and collaborate effectively within teams.

My work is primarily focused on a project called SOLIAM, which provides a centralized solution for real-time investment tracking, offered in two versions: one for asset holders and one for wealth managers. My expertise lies in using Java and Angular for bug fixing, as well as developing new features in Angular..

On a personal note, I have worked with MEAN Stack technology in my Final Year Project, utilizing Angular, Node.js, and MongoDB."
